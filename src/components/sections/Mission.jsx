          I work to understand my clients and deliver workspace environment in
          which they can be effective. At times I challenge their briefs and
          preconceptions as I believe it important to explore the broadest range
          of possibilities to determine which is optimal. To create workspace
          environment that allows employees to work effectively and
          collaboratively
